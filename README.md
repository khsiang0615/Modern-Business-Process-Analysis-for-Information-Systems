This project aims to integrate transportation services provided by the Department of Transportation Services (DOTS) of the University of Maryland, College Park (UMD) and develop a comprehensive mobile application, Moving Terps. It will serve as the main tool for assisting students, faculty, and staff to commute to and travel around the campus.

Moving Terps will serve as the integration of the current Next Bus shuttle service mobile application and the parking portal offered by the Department of Transportation Services (DOTS) of the University of Maryland, College Park (UMD.) The five major modules of this application will be account management, parking service, shuttle bus service, add to favorites, and notification. The application will also be integrated with third-party online payment systems that allows users to pay for parking permits and citations and a mobile identity verification system that enables users to read shuttle bus information and store ride history information.

The team will be using a waterfall and prototype mixed methodology due to the fact that the service provided by DOTS is relatively static; thus, the requirements of the application are well-defined which can be fulfilled in phases. In addition, since we are trying to replace the legacy application and website provided by DOTS, it is crucial to collect feedback from students and faculties so the team can identify changes and refine before the final implementation. All components of this mobile application will be tested before implementation.
